Sublime Text 2 emulation for GNU Emacs. **Requires Emacs 24**.

With a few sane enhancements to cure this otherwise wonderful mode of
some mind-bogglingly insane keybindings that plunge salty old emacs
wyzzards into an abyss of hellish tortures!



Installation
============

This package is available from [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/). Refer to
its documentation to learn how to use Marmalade and `package.el` with your
version of Emacs.
